Agricultural Crop Dataset Description 

This dataset captures a variety of agricultural parameters, providing insights into crop types, soil 
characteristics, environmental conditions, and crop yields. It is an essential resource for analyzing 
trends in crop production and optimizing farming practices. 

Overview of Data Attributes 

• Date: The date when the observation was recorded, formatted as DD-MM-YYYY. 
• Crop_Type: The specific type of crop being analyzed, such as Wheat, Corn, Rice, etc. 
• Soil_Type: The classification of soil in which the crop is grown, including types like Peaty, 
Sandy, or Loamy. 
• Soil_pH: A numeric value representing the pH level of the soil, indicating its acidity or 
alkalinity. 
• Temperature: The recorded ambient temperature during the observation, measured in 
degrees Celsius. 
• Humidity: The relative humidity percentage at the time of observation. 
• Wind_Speed: The speed of the wind, recorded in kilometers per hour. 
• N: The amount of Nitrogen present in the soil, measured in kilograms per hectare. 
• K: The amount of Potassium present in the soil, also measured in kilograms per hectare. 
• Crop_Yield: The yield produced by the crop during the observation, measured in kilograms 
per hectare. 
• Soil_Quality: An index or score representing the quality of the soil, potentially on a 
standardized scale.

Sample Entry 
An example observation from the dataset might indicate that on January 1, 2014, the crop type was 
Corn, grown in Loamy soil with a soil pH of 6.5. The recorded temperature was 20.05°C, with 
humidity at 79.95%. The wind speed was measured at 8.59 km/h. The soil contained 84 kg/ha of 
Nitrogen and 66 kg/ha of Potassium, resulting in a crop yield of 104.87 kg/ha and a soil quality score 
of 66.67. 

Analysis Opportunities 

This dataset offers numerous opportunities for research and analysis, including: 

• Yield Prediction: Using machine learning techniques to predict crop yield based on various 
environmental factors and soil characteristics. 
• Soil Fertility Analysis: Exploring how different soil types and their pH levels influence crop 
productivity, guiding farmers in soil management. 
• Weather Impact Assessment: Investigating how temperature and humidity affect crop 
performance, enabling better planning and adaptation strategies. 
• Nutrient Management: Analyzing the relationship between soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen and 
Potassium) and crop yields, optimizing fertilizer use for better outcomes.

Recommended Steps for Use 

To utilize this dataset effectively, start by cleaning the data to handle any missing or inconsistent 
values. Next, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships between variables. 
Identify key features that influence crop yield and consider engineering new features based on 
interactions between different attributes. Finally, develop predictive models and validate their 
performance using suitable metrics to inform agricultural practices.

Conclusion 

This agricultural crop dataset serves as a valuable tool for researchers, agronomists, and data 
scientists interested in understanding the factors influencing crop production. Its comprehensive 
attributes allow for diverse analyses aimed at enhancing agricultural efficiency and sustainability.
